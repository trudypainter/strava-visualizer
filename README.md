## this python program...
1. gathers a Strava user's routes
2. downloads a gpx file of the route (latitude/longitude coordinates)
3. downloads images of the coordinates from Google Streetivew Static API
4. Stitches videos together to make a timelapse of the route (and cleans up leftover downloaded files afterwards)

i did this for funðŸ’«
